# Pounds To Babies v0.3
## How many babies does something weigh?

Quick and dirty PHP script that is handled via HTML that converts pounds to babies (average 7.5 lb). 

It also has watermelons added for testing purposed.

I want to add more odd items later.

TODO: 
* finish the list of items to convert to. Coffee tables, bottles of beer, microwave burritos, etc.
* add styling and an actual layout
* maybe merge with the rick roll troll page
* 

Changelog.101015: 
* initial push
* added styling
* using watermelon for switch test
* initial functionality working
